# Reading Rocket - Independent Study

* **About**

Reading Rocket is a game designed for the stealth assessment of reading level in middle school children. By recording copious data on fine-grained, subtle behaviors, we hope to predict reading level using a game which is faster, cheaper, and more entertaining than the standard reading level test used in most middle schools. This game is being developed in partnership with educational expert Elliot Sanchez and tested at a local New Orleans school.
